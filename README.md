Winner of JacobsHack 2019 Hackathon held in Bremen, Germany.

This is an initiative for providing an easy way for people on the same flights to instantly connect with each other. 

Technologies used:

We used Skyscanner API to fetch flight information to show to the users. We also used Skyscanner's open-source Backpack to add a little bit of styling to our website. We decided to use Flask for backend and React for frontend. We also used MongoDB to store data and Apache Kafka to simulate the messaging platform.
